# TCP Packet Sniffer from a PCAP file using libpcap C++

This program reads packets from a PCAP file and manually filters them using ETHERNET/IP/TCP headers then prints them to an excel sheet. In the excel sheet, every row's color will be different. Color is checked if it's too dark to increase readability.
